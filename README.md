# Can you help Ted ?
Just a simple game I made to brush up basics of HTML, CSS, JS.This game is an attempt to make something similar to https://guessthecolor.com/.
## Background
**Future Ted** and **Future Barney** have come to the present and have told Ted that the "one" has an **umbrella** with the above color code. The objective is to help Ted to choose the correct color and to meet **the Mother**.
## Modifications
Barney Stinson voice effects have been added to avoid getting bored while playing this simple game.
